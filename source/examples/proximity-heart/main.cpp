 * This is a simple example that uses the micro:bit radio to show if another

 *
 * Each micro:bit is periodically broadcasting a group name, and listening
 * to see if another micro:bit in that group is also in-range. 
 *
 * When another micro:bit in the same group is detected, the display of the
 * detecting micro:bit will show a filled-in heart shape
 *
 * Otherwise, the display will show an empty heart shape
