    // Configuration Tips
    //
    // config.json contains various Bluetooth related properties some of which are explained here:
    //
    // "dfu_service": 1,               // 1 will cause the DFU service to be instantiated
    // "event_service": 1,             // 1 causes the event service to be instantiated
    // "device_info_service": 1
    // "enabled": 1,                   // 1 means the Bluetooth stack will be included as standard. 0 means it will not.
    // "pairing_mode": 1,              // 1 means it's possible to go into pairing mode which will include bringing up the Bluetooth stack whilst in that mode.
    // "open": 0,                      // 1 means there's no Bluetooth security i.e. no need to pair the micro:bit with other devices that want to communicate with it.
    // "tx_power": 7,                  // Transmission power of the Bluetooth radio. A value of 0 - 7 with 0 the lowest power and 7 the highest power.
    // "gatt_table_size": "0x700"      // Amount of memory (in hex bytes) set aside for the Bluetooth GATT table
    // "nested_heap_proportion": 0.75, // Reducing this can sometimes help make enough memory available for all the Bluetooth services you want. Only experiment with this as a last resort.

    // MicrobitConfig.h in yotta_modules\microbit-dal\inc\core contains MICROBIT_BLE_SECURITY_LEVEL which can be set to SECURITY_MODE_ENCRYPTION_WITH_MITM for passkey authentication when
    // pairing or SECURITY_MODE_ENCRYPTION_NO_MITM to use Just Works pairing.

    // A cunning code to indicate during start-up the particular Bluetooth configuration in the build
    //
    // SERVICE CODES
    // A: Accelerometer Service
    // B: Button Service
    // D: Device Information Service
    // E: Event Service
    // F: DFU Service
    // I: IO Pin Service
    // L: LED Service
    // M: Magnetometer Service
    // T: Temperature Service
    // U: UART Service
    //
    // PAIRING CONFIG
    // Note that switching pairing on or off is achieved by setting "open" in config.json to 1 or 0 respectively

    // P: PASSKEY
    // J: Just Works
    // N: No Pairing Required
    //
    // TX Power Level
    // 0-7 taken from tx_power in config.json
